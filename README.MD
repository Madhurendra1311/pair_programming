# Problem
## TODO LIST
Use arrow functions wherever necessary
Use es6 features
Create a TODO application:

Add to do

Remove an item

Edit and update item

There should be a checkbox to indicate if the item has been done or not

If the item is done you should strike it off and not show it on the todo list.

There should be a completed task button to show and hide the task
